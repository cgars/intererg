INTERERG - Interleaved Reference Electroretinogram
-------------

INTERERG is a set of RePros (Research Program's) for the
[RELACS](http://relacs.sourceforge.net/) framework.
 It has been developed to support standard
 [ERG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography) recordings as well as
 Interleaved Reference Electroretinogram  experiments.
This method makes use of a reference light stimulus, which is activated in
alternation with the test stimulus in an interleaved stimulus-reference design.
The test stimulus light intensity is adjusted such that the ERG amplitude
matches that evoked by the reference light. This protocol circumvents the
problem of a drifting baseline and furthermore yields reliable
and comparable sensitivities independent of individual response differences.

INTERERG has so far been been used in:
